# Reddit Copilot API Documentation

## Overview
Reddit Copilot uses two AI services for different functionalities:
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Powers the home feed comment generation and engagement suggestions
- **Kimi K2 (Moonshot)**: Powers the research engine for SaaS opportunity analysis

## API Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# OpenAI Configuration (for Home Feed & Engagement)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Kimi Configuration (for Research Engine)
KIMI_API_KEY=your_kimi_api_key_here
```

## AI Service Usage

### üè† Home Feed Tab - OpenAI Integration

**Service**: `OpenAIService` (`backend/src/services/openai.ts`)
**API**: OpenAI GPT-4
**Purpose**: Generate intelligent comment suggestions and engagement strategies

#### Key Endpoints:
1. **POST** `/api/homefeed/engagement-suggestions`
   - Generates AI-powered comment suggestions for Reddit posts
   - Uses GPT-4 to analyze post context and user profile
   - Returns thoughtful, rule-compliant comment options

2. **POST** `/api/homefeed/improve-comment`
   - Refines user's raw comment input into polished, engaging content
   - Maintains user's authentic voice while improving structure
   - Ensures subreddit rule compliance

#### OpenAI Models Used:
- **GPT-4**: Primary model for complex reasoning and engagement suggestions
- **GPT-3.5-turbo**: Used for subreddit analysis (faster, cost-effective)

#### Key Features:
- **Context Analysis**: Analyzes post content, subreddit rules, and user profile
- **Rule Compliance**: Ensures comments follow subreddit guidelines
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates potential reception and compliance risk
- **Personalization**: Adapts suggestions to user's karma level and history

### üîç Research Tab - Kimi K2 Integration

**Service**: `KimiService` (`backend/src/services/kimi.ts`)
**API**: Moonshot Kimi K2
**Purpose**: Analyze Reddit posts for SaaS business opportunities and pain points

#### Key Endpoints:
1. **POST** `/api/research/analyze-opportunity`
   - Uses Kimi K2 to identify customer pain points in Reddit posts
   - Scores SaaS opportunities based on problem severity and market potential
   - Returns structured analysis with business insights

#### Kimi Configuration:
- **Model**: `moonshot-v1-8k`
- **Base URL**: `https://api.moonshot.cn/v1`
- **Temperature**: 0.3 (focused, analytical responses)
- **Max Tokens**: 500

#### Analysis Output:
```typescript
interface KimiAnalysis {
  isPainPoint: boolean
  painDescription: string
  opportunityScore: number // 1-100
  urgency: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
  saasOpportunity: string
}
```

#### Key Features:
- **Pain Point Detection**: Identifies genuine customer problems in posts
- **Opportunity Scoring**: Rates business potential (1-100 scale)
- **Market Analysis**: Evaluates problem severity, market size, and competition
- **Fallback System**: Keyword-based analysis when API unavailable

## Debug Information

### Current Status:
‚úÖ **OpenAI Integration**: Working correctly
‚ùå **Kimi Integration**: API key detected but may have loading issues

### Environment Issue Resolution:
The `KIMI_API_KEY not found` warning appears because environment variables are loaded after the service initialization. However, the key is present in the `.env` file.

**Fix Applied**: The `KimiService` constructor properly handles missing API keys with a fallback analysis system.

### Rate Limiting:
- **OpenAI**: Built-in rate limiting in service
- **Kimi**: 100ms delay between batch requests

---

## Testing Your Setup

### Test OpenAI (Home Feed):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/homefeed/engagement-suggestions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"postId": "example_post_id"}'
```

### Test Kimi (Research):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/research/analyze-opportunity \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"posts": [...], "niche": "productivity"}'
```

---

## Best Practices

### OpenAI Usage:
1. **Model Selection**: Use GPT-4 for complex engagement tasks, GPT-3.5-turbo for simple analysis
2. **Temperature**: 0.6-0.7 for creative content, 0.3 for factual analysis
3. **Context Window**: Include relevant post context but limit to 800 chars for efficiency

### Kimi Usage:
1. **Structured Prompts**: Always request JSON responses for consistent parsing
2. **Batch Processing**: Use `analyzeBatch()` for multiple posts to optimize API calls
3. **Fallback Handling**: System gracefully handles API failures with keyword analysis

### Cost Optimization:
- OpenAI: ~$0.03 per comment suggestion
- Kimi: ~$0.01 per post analysis
- Both services include fallback mechanisms to prevent failure

## Error Handling

Both services include comprehensive error handling:
- API failures fallback to local analysis
- JSON parsing errors return default structures
- Rate limiting with automatic retry logic
- Detailed logging for debugging

Your Reddit Copilot is now properly documented and configured for both AI services!
