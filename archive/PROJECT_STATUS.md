### API Response Examples
```json
// Profile Response
{
  "username": "CharacterKind3569",
  "totalKarma": 4,
  "recentPosts": [{"title": "Exploring ways to mine Reddit for startup ideas"}]
}

// Suggestions Response
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "title": "Web development trends in India",
      "targetSubreddit": "developersIndia",
      "confidence": 0.7
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🎯 Next Session Focus

**Current Discussion:** Enhancing subreddit efficiency and intelligence

**Options for next development:**
1. **Subreddit Intelligence** - Activity scoring, opportunity ranking
2. **Idea Mining** - Scan for trending topics and opportunities  
3. **Scheduling System** - Optimal posting times
4. **Analytics Dashboard** - Performance tracking

**User Preference:** Focus on subreddit improvements before idea mining

## 📝 Development Notes

### Key Learnings
- Reddit OAuth requires careful scope management (identity,read,history,mysubreddits,submit)
- OpenAI GPT-4 generates highly relevant, personalized content suggestions
- Snoowrap library handles Reddit API complexity well
- Next.js proxy configuration enables seamless frontend-backend communication

### Technical Decisions Made
- SQLite for simplicity and portability
- Token encryption for security
- Header-based authentication (x-reddit-id) for simplicity
- Component-based React architecture for maintainability

### Known Issues Resolved
- ✅ Reddit OAuth "invalid client id" - Fixed with proper credentials
- ✅ TypeScript snoowrap compatibility - Using @ts-ignore strategically
- ✅ JSON escaping in curl requests - Proper string handling
- ✅ Submit permissions for posting - Added to OAuth scope

## 🚀 Deployment Readiness

**Current Status:** Development ready, production considerations needed

**For Production:**
- [ ] Environment variable security
- [ ] PostgreSQL migration
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation
- [ ] Error logging and monitoring
- [ ] User authentication system
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel + Railway

**MVP Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - All core functionality working
